# Jenkins 2 Pipelines & Docker Builds

This is just my own little project to try and use the new(ish) Jenkins pipelines to do docker builds & deploys.

## Docker Builds
This is pretty straight-forward. As long as the jenkins user has access to a running docker instance, it should be able to do builds

## Pipeline

A couple of tricky things that was included in this Jenkins file as examples. The Jenkinsfile format has changed since version 2, since a number of older examples don't work, and the jenkins referances are a bit vague.

* Parallel
* Milestones
* Pause to wait for user input
* Stages
